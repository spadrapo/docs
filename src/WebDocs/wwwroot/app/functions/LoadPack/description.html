<p>The LoadPack function loads a predefined pack of files from the server. A <strong>pack</strong> is a collection of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) that are bundled together on the server and delivered as a single compressed file to improve performance and reduce the number of HTTP requests.</p>

<p>When LoadPack is called with a pack name, it:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Retrieves the bundled pack</strong> - Downloads all files defined in the pack as a single compressed file from the server</li>
  <li><strong>Unpacks the content</strong> - Automatically extracts and places each file in its correct location in the frontend</li>
  <li><strong>Caches the files</strong> - Makes the unpacked files immediately available for use by other Drapo functions like UpdateSector</li>
</ul>

<p>Packs are defined in the Drapo configuration and support:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wildcard patterns</strong> - Include multiple files using patterns like <code>*.html</code> or <code>components/**/*.js</code></li>
  <li><strong>Exclusion patterns</strong> - Exclude specific files or patterns from the pack</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple paths</strong> - Include files from different directories in a single pack</li>
  <li><strong>Compression</strong> - Files are automatically compressed (Brotli/Gzip/Deflate) for optimal performance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dynamic Packs</h3>
<p>Packs can also be configured as <strong>dynamic</strong>, allowing their content to be generated at runtime through a delegate handler. Dynamic packs provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Runtime content generation</strong> - Pack content is generated on-demand when requested, allowing for user-specific or context-dependent content</li>
  <li><strong>Delegate handler</strong> - A configurable <code>HandlerPackDynamic</code> delegate in DrapoConfig that receives the pack request and returns dynamically generated content</li>
  <li><strong>HTTP caching support</strong> - Dynamic packs support ETags for proper HTTP caching, reducing unnecessary data transfer</li>
  <li><strong>Flexible content structure</strong> - Content can be provided as a structured list of files or as pre-serialized JSON</li>
</ul>

<p>Dynamic packs are created by setting the <code>IsDynamic</code> flag when defining the pack in the configuration, and configuring a delegate handler that will be called to generate the pack content each time it's requested.</p>

<p>This function is particularly useful for loading component libraries, themes, or any collection of related files that should be loaded together as a unit, whether predefined or generated dynamically.</p>
