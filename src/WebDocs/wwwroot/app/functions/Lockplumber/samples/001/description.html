<p>This sample demonstrates how to use Lockplumber to control real-time pipe message processing. When the plumber is locked, incoming messages from the backend (via d-dataPipes) are queued instead of being processed immediately. This is useful for scenarios where you want to batch updates or temporarily pause real-time communication.</p>
